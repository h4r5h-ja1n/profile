 After coming to Roorkee ,i started programming , firstly with JAVA and then i started looking into other programming languages and as the time passed ,i learnt HTML , CSS , Javascript , Jquery ,php , SQL ,,but I am still a beginner and often
get problems in my code , though mostly i ,at the end , rule them over . Now i am mainly a web developer and thinking of expanding my knowledge of Development . I have started looking into networking kind of stuff and also planning to start
ethical hacking ,since it helps to thinking as a black-hat hacker who may find a flaw in the code and do something malicious .My future plans are getting hold of Python as the main programming language and to go with the plan and schedule
of SDSLabs .
